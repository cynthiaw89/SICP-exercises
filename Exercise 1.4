Exercise 1.4. Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. 
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:


(define (mystery a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
Describe the behavior of the procedure by selecting which descriptions are equivalent. 
If you think that the procedure definition is invalid, choose the reasons why.

X (if (> b 0) (+ a b) (- a b)) [This is because the operators + and - are the consequent and alternative (respectively) which will act upon a b.]
(+ a (abs b)) [This is another way to state the above expression (Thanks Google)]
(+ a (if (> b 0) b (- b))) [This is another way to express]
